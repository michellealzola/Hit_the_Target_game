# GAME: Hit the Target
# Description 
Modified the exercise in Chapter 3 of Starting Out with Python, 5th Edition by Tony Gaddis. 
Added to the project is the random generation of the target's position and the ability to choose to play again or to exit.
It also includes a prompt that says if the force and angle are smaller or bigger than the target.
